    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Man pages are an essential part of every developer&rsquo;s workflow. Unfortunately,
the default system pager <code>less</code> isn&rsquo;t the best interface. That&rsquo;s why I wrote a
Vim plugin and a short shell function to take care of opening man pages in Vim.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>The Plugin</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re eager to dive right into the source or to install the plugin, head on
over to the <a href="https://github.com/Z1MM32M4N/vim-superman">GitHub repository</a>. It&rsquo;s a whopping 32 SLOC, so feel
free to peek under the hood.</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>You might be thinking, &ldquo;But Jake, <code>man</code> works just fine for me, why would I
switch?&rdquo; I&rsquo;m glad you asked!</p>

<h3>Mouse Support</h3>

<p>The first reason why I was interested in getting man pages to open in Vim was
because I wanted to be able to scroll with the mouse. When I have to read man
pages for a long time, usually as a part of some more all-encompasing bit of
research, I find scrolling to be a much better interface for quickly perusing
the content of a man page.</p>

<h3>Syntax Highlighting</h3>

<p>As it turns out, man pages have a syntax to them, and Vim does a pretty
excellent job at highlighting them. Rather than talk about it, here are some
screenshots. Note how code samples (C system calls and library functions) are
also syntax highlighted appropriately.</p>

<pre><code class="bash Example 1">vman vim
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/images/vim.1.png" alt="vim(1)" /></p>

<pre><code class="bash Example 2">vman 3 printf
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/images/printf.3.png" alt="printf(3)" /></p>

<h3>All the benefits of Vim</h3>

<p>While <code>less</code> makes a good effort to emulate certain Vim keybindings (or maybe
it&rsquo;s the other way around, I don&rsquo;t know which came first), <code>less</code> certainly
falls short of the full power of Vim.</p>

<p>For example, once you&rsquo;ve opened a man page in Vim, you can open a new tab or
split side-by-side with the man page. Especially if you&rsquo;re switching between Vim
and the man page often, being able to open man pages in tabs or splits is
invaluable.</p>

<h2>Mine doesn&rsquo;t look like yours!</h2>

<p>A couple of my other plugins are showing in the screenshots above. I&rsquo;m using the
<a href="https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized">Solarized Dark color scheme</a>, the plugin
<a href="https://github.com/bling/vim-airline">vim-airline</a> to take over the statuslines at the very top and
bottom, and iTerm2 on Mac OS X 10.10.</p>

<p>You can see my complete configuration <a href="https://github.com/Z1MM32M4N/dotfiles">on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>

<p>As a matter of fact, this was my first Vim plugin! If you notice anything out of
place, even if it&rsquo;s a small detail, I&rsquo;d love to hear it. Make no assumptions
about the reasoning behind why certain decisions were made, because I have none
XD</p>
