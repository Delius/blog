<h2>Running a VPS</h2>

<p>Inspired in part by the <a href="http://www.club.cc.cmu.edu/talks/vps.html">Computer Club talk</a> and in part by my inability to do anything quickly on a raspberry pi, I recently decided to rent out a VPS from DigitalOcean. Read on for notes and ramblings about what I&rsquo;m using it for.</p>

<h2>JavaScript Adventures</h2>

<p>Over at ScottyLabs, we&rsquo;re planning some super awesome talks and labs to teach web development during the upcoming semester, so I&rsquo;ve been hard at work compiling and writing some awesome JavaScript demos, resources, and projects.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/2014/06/16/why-everyone-loves-javascript/">Why Everyone Loves JavaScript</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Edit: Web Dev Weeks was a hit! If you had the chance to come to one of the talks, great! We&rsquo;ll be holding similar events later in the year, too. If you didn&rsquo;t make it, here&rsquo;s what you missed:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="//scottylabs.org/webdevweeks/">Web Dev Weeks homepage</a></li>
<li><a href="//scottylabs.org/webdevweeks/frontend/">My Frontend Development (JavaScript) workshop</a></li>
</ul>


<hr />

<h2>Print@ScottyLabs</h2>

<p>Okay, so I haven&rsquo;t actually started this one yet, but I will be soon! I&rsquo;ll be rewriting the service from just about the ground up, adding tons of cool features along the way.</p>

<p>In the mean time, if mail servers, Python 3, and Django are your thing, you may want to check out the following links that I&rsquo;ve come across while doing a bit of research.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.4.html#whatsnew-email-contentmanager">Python 3.4.1 and MIME Multipart Messages</a> </strong></li>
<li><strong> <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.7/">Django 1.7 to include built-in schema migrations</a> </strong></li>
</ul>


<p>Edit: I&rsquo;ve started Print 2.0, and it&rsquo;s moving slowly now that classes have started to pick up. I have done a bit of work on it though, and I&rsquo;ll be documenting it soon. Since it&rsquo;s no longer the summer, though, it won&rsquo;t be published under the Summer Project Series tag.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Airbnb has put together a stellar list of simple ways to make your JavaScript more maintainable and manageable. From comments and whitespace, to hoisting and type casting, this list covers nearly everything you should know when developing a JavaScript app.</p>

<h2>The Backstory</h2>

<p>Before I begin, I should mention that any views I express here are entirely my own. Now, I recently began working for the summer at Bloomberg L.P., where for the first few days we sit through a few talks and do a few labs that introduce us to the technologies we&rsquo;ll be using throughout the summer. JavaScript was one of these languages, and I found that a quote on the first slide is all too correct:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;JavaScript is both the most popular and unpopular programming language.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ndash; Doug Crockford</p></blockquote>

<p>From there, as you might imagine, the reactions from a predominantly C++ oriented audience towards JavaScript&rsquo;s quirks were pretty amusing. There are some significant differences between these two languages, and if you&rsquo;re not careful, they can get annoying quite quickly.</p>

<h2>Links</h2>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/airbnb/javascript">airbnb/javascript</a></h3>

<p>JavaScript might have it&rsquo;s quirks, but it&rsquo;s still a vastly powerful language, especially if used well. For any aspiring JavaScript developer, I would highly recommend looking over Airbnb&rsquo;s JavaScript best practices. Even if you think you&rsquo;ve got the language down, I&rsquo;m confident you&rsquo;ll uncover something useful.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript">The Birth and Death of JavaScript</a></h3>

<p>While you&rsquo;re here, check out this video for an incredibly humorous and satisfyingly accurate discussion of JavaScript, from birth to death.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat">Wat</a></h3>

<p>Aaand while we&rsquo;re posting humorous JavaScript videos, I&rsquo;ve gotta throw this one into the mix.</p>
