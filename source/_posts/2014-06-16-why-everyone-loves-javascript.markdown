Airbnb has put together a stellar list of simple ways to make your JavaScript more maintainable and manageable. From comments and whitespace, to hoisting and type casting, this list covers nearly everything you should know when developing a JavaScript app.

## The Backstory
You might have only clicked on this link thinking, "Hold up, shouldn't that read 'no one' instead of 'everyone'?" For you folks, I have only this quote:

> "God I love JavaScript." 
> 
> -- Tom Shen

Of course, he quickly followed that up with some complaint about how he had to dig through someone else's JavaScript project to debug an issue with an `===` that should have been an `==`. (Yes, in this case, this is right. See [here](https://github.com/mikeal/request/pull/932/files) for what was going wrong.)

Okay, so maybe JavaScript has it's quirks, but it's still a vastly powerful language, if used well. For any aspiring JavaScript developer, I would highly recommend looking over Airbnb's JavaScript best practices. Even if you think you've got the language down, I'm confident you'll uncover something useful.
