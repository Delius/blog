If you cared enough to read that far, you should consider following me on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/Z1MM32M4N/) or checking out my tinkerings on [GitHub](http://www.github.com/Z1MM32M4N/) or [my homepage](http://www.zimmerman.io/). I'd love to year what you think about what I've managed to put together, so feel free to comment, tweet at me, or send me an email.
