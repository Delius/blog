    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;ve never heard of <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> for web hosting, you should definitely check it out. (You basically get free hosting for any all static or <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> website with git-push-to-deploy). You can configure your site to be listed at a custom domain according to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages">these</a> instructions, which are very thorough. I feel like it&rsquo;d help, though, to supplement this documentation with a fairly common example setup.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>My setup</h2>

<p>I have two sites which I want to host using the <code>zimmerman.io</code> domain name: my <a href="//blog.zimmerman.io">blog</a> and my <a href="//www.zimmerman.io">personal site</a>. I host my personal site at <a href="//www.zimmerman.io">www.zimmerman.io</a>, but you can also navigate to <a href="//zimmerman.io">zimmerman.io</a> and end up in the same places as before. It&rsquo;s served as a User Page <a href="https://www.github.com/Z1MM32M4N/z1mm32m4n.github.io">here</a>.</p>

<p>I host my blog at <a href="//blog.zimmerman.io">blog.zimmerman.io</a>, and it&rsquo;s served as a Project Page in <a href="https://www.github.com/Z1MM32M4N/blog/">this repo</a>.</p>

<h2>What the instructions say</h2>

<p>The instructions say a few things very clearly (yay, documentation!).</p>

<p>First, if I want to use a custom subdomain (like what I&rsquo;m doing for my blog) to host a repo, I can add a <code>CNAME</code> record with my DNS provider that points to what is in my case <code>z1mm32m4n.github.io</code>. This was counterintuitive to me, because I thought at first that this would make my blog.zimmerman.io domain redirect to my personal site, but that&rsquo;s not how GitHub handles it. (They&rsquo;re smarter than that.)</p>

<p>At the same time, I need to put a file in the root of the blog&rsquo;s repo (in the <code>gh-pages</code> branch because it&rsquo;s a Project Page), called <code>CNAME</code> (<a href="https://github.com/Z1MM32M4N/blog/blob/gh-pages/CNAME">view source</a>) with the contents &lsquo;blog.zimmerman.io&rsquo;. After a little while, the DNS tables will update and everything here should work: I can now view my <em>blog</em> where I want it.</p>

<h2>What the instructions say, but not so clearly</h2>

<p>The next bit gave me some trouble at first (probably just because I was being impatient while the DNS tables were updating). The end goal was to have the <code>www</code> subdomain host my site and have the <code>@</code> (the top-level or apex domain) redirect there. If you read carefully, the instructions say three things:</p>

<ol>
<li> Make the <code>CNAME</code> file (<a href="https://github.com/Z1MM32M4N/z1mm32m4n.github.io/blob/master/CNAME">view source</a>) in my (User) Pages repository contain <code>www.zimmerman.io</code>. <strong>This</strong> is the domain at which I do want my site to be visible.</li>
<li> Create a <code>CNAME</code> record with my DNS provider pointing to <code>z1mm32m4n.github.io</code>, as before with the <code>blog</code> subdomain.</li>
<li> Make the <code>@</code> domain redirect to GitHub like normal, and let GitHub do some magic to handle the rest.</li>
</ol>


<p>This was a little confusing at first, because if I wanted the opposite direction (www.zimmerman.io to redirect to zimmerman.io), I would have still created a CNAME file, but it would have contained <code>zimmerman.io</code> and I would have created an <code>A</code> record with my DNS provider, not an actual CNAME. (I still did have to create both the <code>A</code> and <code>CNAME</code> in the end, but in this setup, the <code>A</code> record is referenced in the <code>CNAME</code> file, if that makes any sense.)</p>

<h2>Recap</h2>

<h3>My CNAME Files</h3>

<ul>
<li> For www.zimmerman.io:

<ul>
<li> CNAME file contains <code>www.zimmerman.io</code></li>
<li> CNAME file resides in <code>master</code> branch of User Pages repo for Z1MM32M4N</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> For blog.zimmerman.io

<ul>
<li> CNAME file contains <code>blog.zimmerman.io</code></li>
<li> CNAME file resides in <code>gh-pages</code> branch of Project Pages repo for Z1MM32M4N/blog</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>My DNS Config</h3>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a screenshot of what my records look like with my DNS provider, in case this was still unclear.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m personally using <a href="https://www.gandi.net/">Gandi</a> for domain registration because they had the cheapest <code>.io</code> TLD registration, but their interface takes some getting used to. (It was certainly still worth the deal I got.)</p>
